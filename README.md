# Sorting Visualization Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Sorting Visualization Project! This project aims to provide an interactive and educational experience for understanding various sorting algorithms. By visualizing these algorithms in action, users can gain deeper insights into how they work and their efficiency in sorting data.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Watch how different sorting algorithms process and sort a list of numbers in real-time.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes visualizations for popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Users can input their own list of numbers or generate random lists to see how the algorithms perform.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the visualizations to see each step in detail or speed up the process.
- **Intuitive UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the sorting algorithms and creating the visualizations.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualization.git
   cd sorting-visualization
   ```

2. **Open the Index File**:
   Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the application.

3. **Select an Algorithm**:
   Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.

4. **Input Data**:
   Enter a custom list of numbers or generate a random list.

5. **Start Visualization**:
   Click the "Start" button to see the algorithm in action. Use the speed slider to adjust the visualization speed.

## Sorting Algorithms Included

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region and iteratively selects the smallest element from the unsorted region.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: Another divide and conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.
- **Heap Sort**: Converts the list into a binary heap structure and repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap to build the sorted list.
